Initial visits include an in-person physician evaluation, on-site lab draw, and individualized protocol design. Follow-up visits can be in-person at the Brickell office or via telehealth. Call (754) 263-6026 to book a free assessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What peptides does Strong Health Miami prescribe?",
      answer:
        "Our Miami physicians prescribe pharmacy-grade peptides selected for the patient's specific goals and labs. The most commonly used protocols include BPC-157 and TB-500 for tendon, joint, and soft-tissue healing; CJC-1295 with Ipamorelin for body composition, sleep, and recovery; Tesamorelin for visceral (belly) fat reduction; PT-141 for sexual desire and arousal; DSIP for deep-sleep architecture; and clinical-grade collagen peptides for connective tissue and skin support. Every protocol is individualized — we don't use one-size-fits-all stacks.",

    {
      question: "Are peptides legal in Florida?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when prescribed by a licensed Florida physician and dispensed through a licensed compounding pharmacy. Strong Health Miami works only with 503A and 503B pharmacies under physician orders. We do not work with research-only or gray-market peptides. Every protocol uses pharmacy-grade product with full physician oversight, ongoing monitoring, and standard Florida medical-record documentation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does peptide therapy cost at Strong Health Miami?",
      answer:
        "Your initial assessment at the Brickell clinic is free. Peptide protocols are month-to-month with transparent pricing — costs vary by peptide, dose, and duration. Most protocols include physician visits, monitoring labs, and pharmacy-compounded medication. We'll review the full cost of your specific protocol before you commit to anything. We do not bill insurance directly, but we provide itemized superbills that many Miami patients submit to plans like Florida Blue, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna for partial reimbursement.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern, rather than introducing exogenous hormone. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health Miami patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on the tissue involved. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health Miami protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need an in-person visit, or can I start peptide therapy by telehealth?",
      answer:
        "Florida law and our clinical standards require an in-person physician evaluation before starting peptide therapy at Strong Health Miami. Your first visit at the Brickell clinic includes a physical exam, full medical history, on-site lab draw, and a detailed discussion of goals. After your baseline visit, follow-ups can be conducted via telehealth — including dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — with periodic in-person check-ins for labs and physical reassessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can peptide therapy be combined with TRT at the Miami clinic?",
      answer:
        "Yes, and many Brickell-area patients do exactly that. Strong Health Miami physicians frequently design combined protocols pairing testosterone replacement therapy with GH-secretagogue peptides like CJC-1295/Ipamorelin for body composition and recovery, or with BPC-157 for active patients managing sports-related soft-tissue injuries. Because both therapies are designed and monitored by the same physician using the same lab panels, dose interactions and overall response are tracked together rather than in silos.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there side effects or risks with peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "When prescribed by a board-certified physician with proper labs and monitoring, peptides used in clinical practice have a generally favorable safety profile. The most common side effects are mild and protocol-specific: temporary injection-site irritation, transient water retention or hunger with GH secretagogues, brief flushing or nausea with PT-141, and grogginess if DSIP is dosed incorrectly. Contraindications include active malignancy, certain endocrine disorders, and pregnancy. Strong Health Miami screens for contraindications during your initial assessment and monitors relevant labs (IGF-1, glucose, hormones) on an ongoing basis.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does the Miami clinic offer Spanish-speaking peptide therapy consultations?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Our Brickell clinic offers bilingual care in English and Spanish. Dr. Rivera and several team members are fluent in Spanish, reflecting the Miami-Dade communities we serve. Initial peptide consultations, lab reviews, and follow-up visits can all be conducted in Spanish if preferred.",

    {
      question: "What peptides does Strong Health Delray Beach prescribe?",
      answer:
        "Our Delray Beach physicians prescribe pharmacy-grade peptides selected for the patient's specific goals and labs. The most commonly used protocols include BPC-157 and TB-500 for tendon, joint, and soft-tissue healing; CJC-1295 with Ipamorelin for body composition, sleep, and recovery; Tesamorelin for visceral (belly) fat reduction; PT-141 for sexual desire and arousal; DSIP for deep-sleep architecture; and clinical-grade collagen peptides for connective tissue and skin support. Every protocol is individualized — we don't use one-size-fits-all stacks.",

      question: "Are peptides legal in Florida?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when prescribed by a licensed Florida physician and dispensed through a licensed compounding pharmacy. Strong Health Delray Beach works only with 503A and 503B pharmacies under physician orders. We do not work with research-only or gray-market peptides. Every protocol uses pharmacy-grade product with full physician oversight, ongoing monitoring, and standard Florida medical-record documentation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does peptide therapy cost at Strong Health Delray Beach?",
      answer:
        "Your initial telehealth consult is free. Peptide protocols are month-to-month with transparent pricing — costs vary by peptide, dose, and duration. Most protocols include physician visits, monitoring labs, and pharmacy-compounded medication. We'll review the full cost of your specific protocol before you commit. We do not bill insurance directly, but we provide itemized superbills that many Palm Beach County patients submit to plans like Florida Blue, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna for partial reimbursement.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health Delray Beach patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on tissue. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health Delray Beach protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need an in-person visit, or can I start peptide therapy by telehealth?",
      answer:
        "Florida law and our clinical standards require an in-person physician evaluation before starting peptide therapy. For Delray Beach patients, that baseline visit is scheduled at our Miami Brickell clinic (1000 Brickell Plaza, Miami, FL 33131) and includes a physical exam, full medical history, on-site lab draw, and a detailed discussion of goals. After your baseline visit, follow-ups are conducted via telehealth — including dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — with periodic in-person check-ins at the Brickell clinic for labs and physical reassessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can peptide therapy be combined with TRT at the Delray Beach clinic?",
      answer:
        "Yes, and many Delray Beach patients do exactly that. Strong Health physicians frequently design combined protocols pairing testosterone replacement therapy with GH-secretagogue peptides like CJC-1295/Ipamorelin for body composition and recovery, or with BPC-157 for active patients managing sports-related soft-tissue injuries. Because both therapies are designed and monitored by the same physician using the same lab panels, dose interactions and overall response are tracked together rather than in silos.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stay on peptide therapy if I split time between Delray Beach and another city?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Many Delray patients are seasonal residents who split the year between South Florida and a second residence up north. Telehealth follow-ups travel with you, and we coordinate compounding-pharmacy refills with a partner pharmacy near wherever you happen to be. Initial in-person visits and scheduled lab reassessments are scheduled at our Miami Brickell clinic during your time in South Florida.",

    },
    {
      question: "What peptides does Strong Health prescribe for New York patients?",
      answer:
        "Our physicians prescribe pharmacy-grade peptides selected for the patient's specific goals and labs. The most commonly used protocols include BPC-157 and TB-500 for tendon, joint, and soft-tissue healing; CJC-1295 with Ipamorelin for body composition, sleep, and recovery; Tesamorelin for visceral (belly) fat reduction; PT-141 for sexual desire and arousal; DSIP for deep-sleep architecture; and clinical-grade collagen peptides for connective tissue and skin support. Every protocol is individualized — we don't use one-size-fits-all stacks.",

    {
      question: "Are peptides legal in New York?",

We do not work with research-only or gray-market peptides. Every protocol uses pharmacy-grade product with full physician oversight, ongoing monitoring, and standard medical-record documentation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does peptide therapy cost for New York patients?",
      answer:
        "Your initial telehealth consult is free. Peptide protocols are month-to-month with transparent pricing — costs vary by peptide, dose, and duration. Most protocols include physician visits, monitoring labs, and pharmacy-compounded medication. We'll review the full cost of your specific protocol before you commit. We do not bill insurance directly, but we provide itemized superbills that many New York patients submit to plans like UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Cigna, and Empire BlueCross BlueShield for partial reimbursement.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on tissue. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start peptide therapy entirely by telehealth in New York?",
      answer:
        "Yes. New York patients start with a telehealth evaluation by a Strong Health physician licensed in New York, including a full medical history and a detailed discussion of goals. Baseline labs are ordered to a local lab draw site near you before any peptide is prescribed, and follow-ups — dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — are conducted via telehealth with repeat labs at the same draw site.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can peptide therapy be combined with TRT for New York patients?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Strong Health physicians frequently design combined protocols pairing testosterone replacement therapy with GH-secretagogue peptides like CJC-1295/Ipamorelin for body composition and recovery, or with BPC-157 for active patients managing sports-related soft-tissue injuries. Because both therapies are designed and monitored by the same physician using the same lab panels, dose interactions and overall response are tracked together rather than in silos.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which New York boroughs and neighborhoods do you serve?",
      answer:
        "All five boroughs — Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island — plus the surrounding New York metro area. Because care is delivered via telehealth with labs at local lab draw sites, you can start and stay on a protocol whether you're in the Financial District, Williamsburg, Astoria, Riverdale, or St. George.",

Most protocols include physician visits, monitoring labs, and pharmacy-compounded medication. We'll review the full cost of your specific protocol before you commit. We do not bill insurance directly, but we provide itemized superbills that many San Diego patients submit to plans like Blue Shield of California, Anthem Blue Cross, Aetna, and Cigna for partial reimbursement.",

    {
      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on tissue. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start peptide therapy entirely by telehealth in San Diego?",
      answer:
        "Yes. San Diego patients start with a telehealth evaluation by a Strong Health physician licensed in California, including a full medical history and a detailed discussion of goals. Baseline labs are ordered to a local lab draw site near you before any peptide is prescribed, and follow-ups — dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — are conducted via telehealth with repeat labs at the same draw site.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can peptide therapy be combined with TRT for San Diego patients?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Strong Health physicians frequently design combined protocols pairing testosterone replacement therapy with GH-secretagogue peptides like CJC-1295/Ipamorelin for body composition and recovery, or with BPC-157 for active patients managing sports-related soft-tissue injuries. Because both therapies are designed and monitored by the same physician using the same lab panels, dose interactions and overall response are tracked together rather than in silos.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which San Diego neighborhoods and cities do you serve?",
      answer:
        "All of San Diego County — from La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Downtown, and Point Loma to Carmel Valley, Del Mar, Encinitas, and Carlsbad in North County, plus Chula Vista, Coronado, El Cajon, La Mesa, and Poway. Because care is delivered via telehealth with labs at local lab draw sites, you can start and stay on a protocol wherever in the county you live.",

      question: "What peptides does Strong Health prescribe for Atlanta patients?",
      answer:
        "Our physicians prescribe pharmacy-grade peptides selected for the patient's specific goals and labs. The most commonly used protocols include BPC-157 and TB-500 for tendon, joint, and soft-tissue healing; CJC-1295 with Ipamorelin for body composition, sleep, and recovery; Tesamorelin for visceral (belly) fat reduction; PT-141 for sexual desire and arousal; DSIP for deep-sleep architecture; and clinical-grade collagen peptides for connective tissue and skin support.

        "Your initial telehealth consult is free. Peptide protocols are month-to-month with transparent pricing — costs vary by peptide, dose, and duration. Most protocols include physician visits, monitoring labs, and pharmacy-compounded medication. We'll review the full cost of your specific protocol before you commit.

      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on tissue. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start peptide therapy entirely by telehealth in Atlanta?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Atlanta patients start with a telehealth evaluation by a Strong Health physician licensed in Georgia, including a full medical history and a detailed discussion of goals. Baseline labs are ordered to a local lab draw site near you before any peptide is prescribed, and follow-ups — dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — are conducted via telehealth with repeat labs at the same draw site.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can peptide therapy be combined with TRT for Atlanta patients?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Strong Health physicians frequently design combined protocols pairing testosterone replacement therapy with GH-secretagogue peptides like CJC-1295/Ipamorelin for body composition and recovery, or with BPC-157 for active patients managing sports-related soft-tissue injuries. Because both therapies are designed and monitored by the same physician using the same lab panels, dose interactions and overall response are tracked together rather than in silos.",

Call (754) 263-6026 to book a free assessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What peptides does Strong Health prescribe for Tampa patients?",
      answer:
        "Our physicians prescribe pharmacy-grade peptides selected for the patient's specific goals and labs. The most commonly used protocols include BPC-157 and TB-500 for tendon, joint, and soft-tissue healing; CJC-1295 with Ipamorelin for body composition, sleep, and recovery; Tesamorelin for visceral (belly) fat reduction; PT-141 for sexual desire and arousal; DSIP for deep-sleep architecture; and clinical-grade collagen peptides for connective tissue and skin support. Every protocol is individualized — we don't use one-size-fits-all stacks.",

    {
      question: "Are peptides legal in Florida?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when prescribed by a physician licensed in Florida and dispensed through a licensed compounding pharmacy. Strong Health works only with 503A and 503B pharmacies under physician orders. We do not work with research-only or gray-market peptides. Every protocol uses pharmacy-grade product with full physician oversight, ongoing monitoring, and standard medical-record documentation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does peptide therapy cost for Tampa patients?",
      answer:
        "Your initial telehealth consult is free. Peptide protocols are month-to-month with transparent pricing — costs vary by peptide, dose, and duration. Most protocols include physician visits, monitoring labs, and pharmacy-compounded medication. We'll review the full cost of your specific protocol before you commit. We do not bill insurance directly, but we provide itemized superbills that many Tampa patients submit to plans like Florida Blue, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Cigna for partial reimbursement.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on tissue. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start peptide therapy entirely by telehealth in Tampa?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Tampa patients start with a telehealth evaluation by a Strong Health physician licensed in Florida, including a full medical history and a detailed discussion of goals. Baseline labs are ordered to a local lab draw site near you before any peptide is prescribed, and follow-ups — dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — are conducted via telehealth with repeat labs at the same draw site.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can peptide therapy be combined with TRT for Tampa patients?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Strong Health physicians frequently design combined protocols pairing testosterone replacement therapy with GH-secretagogue peptides like CJC-1295/Ipamorelin for body composition and recovery, or with BPC-157 for active patients managing sports-related soft-tissue injuries. Because both therapies are designed and monitored by the same physician using the same lab panels, dose interactions and overall response are tracked together rather than in silos.",

Whether you're a timber or oil-field worker whose shoulders and knees have taken twenty years of abuse, an SFA athlete or weekend lifter rehabbing a tendon, a rancher trying to sleep through the night again, or someone finally tackling the visceral belly fat that won't budge, we use specific peptides for specific clinical reasons — and we monitor the relevant labs throughout the protocol.",

Peptide therapy done right is physician-led medicine. It starts with bloodwork, not a sales script.",
    "Strong Health designs peptide protocols for Los Angeles patients around individual labs and goals. Whether you're rehabbing a climbing or jiu-jitsu injury, dropping visceral belly fat that won't budge before a shoot, fixing sleep wrecked by production schedules, restoring desire and arousal, or maintaining the body composition you work hard for at the gym, we use specific peptides for specific clinical reasons — and we monitor the relevant labs throughout the protocol.",

        "Our physicians prescribe pharmacy-grade peptides selected for the patient's specific goals and labs. The most commonly used protocols include BPC-157 and TB-500 for tendon, joint, and soft-tissue healing; CJC-1295 with Ipamorelin for body composition, sleep, and recovery; Tesamorelin for visceral (belly) fat reduction; PT-141 for sexual desire and arousal; DSIP for deep-sleep architecture; and clinical-grade collagen peptides for connective tissue and skin support.

        "Three things: a physician evaluation before anything is prescribed, real labs before and during the protocol, and pharmacy-grade compounds from licensed 503A/503B compounders. Much of what's sold around Los Angeles is \"research-grade\" product handed out with little screening and no monitoring. Strong Health screens contraindications, titrates doses against your bloodwork, and documents everything in a standard medical record — the way prescription medicine is supposed to work.",

    {
      question: "How much does peptide therapy cost for Los Angeles patients?",
      answer:
        "Your initial telehealth consult is free. Peptide protocols are month-to-month with transparent pricing — costs vary by peptide, dose, and duration. Most protocols include physician visits, monitoring labs, and pharmacy-compounded medication. We'll review the full cost of your specific protocol before you commit. We do not bill insurance directly, but we provide itemized superbills that many Los Angeles patients submit to plans like Blue Shield of California, Anthem Blue Cross, Health Net, and Cigna for partial reimbursement.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on tissue. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start peptide therapy entirely by telehealth in Los Angeles?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Los Angeles patients start with a telehealth evaluation by a Strong Health physician licensed in California, including a full medical history and a detailed discussion of goals. Baseline labs are ordered to a local lab draw site near you before any peptide is prescribed, and follow-ups — dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — are conducted via telehealth with repeat labs at the same draw site.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which Los Angeles neighborhoods and cities do you serve?",
      answer:
        "All of LA County — the Westside (Santa Monica, Venice, Brentwood, Culver City), central LA (Hollywood, West Hollywood, Silver Lake, Los Feliz, Downtown), the Valley (Studio City, Sherman Oaks, Encino, Burbank, Glendale), Pasadena, the South Bay (Manhattan Beach, El Segundo), and Long Beach.

      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on tissue. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start peptide therapy entirely by telehealth in Raleigh?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Raleigh patients start with a telehealth evaluation by a Strong Health physician licensed in North Carolina, including a full medical history and a detailed discussion of goals. Baseline labs are ordered to a local lab draw site near you before any peptide is prescribed, and follow-ups — dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — are conducted via telehealth with repeat labs at the same draw site.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can peptide therapy be combined with TRT for Raleigh patients?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Strong Health physicians frequently design combined protocols pairing testosterone replacement therapy with GH-secretagogue peptides like CJC-1295/Ipamorelin for body composition and recovery, or with BPC-157 for active patients managing sports-related soft-tissue injuries. Because both therapies are designed and monitored by the same physician using the same lab panels, dose interactions and overall response are tracked together rather than in silos.",

    },
    {
      question: "What peptides does Strong Health prescribe for Bellevue patients?",
      answer:
        "Our physicians prescribe pharmacy-grade peptides selected for the patient's specific goals and labs. The most commonly used protocols include BPC-157 and TB-500 for tendon, joint, and soft-tissue healing; CJC-1295 with Ipamorelin for body composition, sleep, and recovery; Tesamorelin for visceral (belly) fat reduction; PT-141 for sexual desire and arousal; DSIP for deep-sleep architecture; and clinical-grade collagen peptides for connective tissue and skin support. Every protocol is individualized — we don't use one-size-fits-all stacks.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are peptides legal in Washington?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when prescribed by a physician licensed in Washington and dispensed through a licensed compounding pharmacy. Strong Health works only with 503A and 503B pharmacies under physician orders. We do not work with research-only or gray-market peptides. Every protocol uses pharmacy-grade product with full physician oversight, ongoing monitoring, and standard medical-record documentation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does peptide therapy cost for Bellevue patients?",
      answer:
        "Your initial telehealth consult is free. Peptide protocols are month-to-month with transparent pricing — costs vary by peptide, dose, and duration. Most protocols include physician visits, monitoring labs, and pharmacy-compounded medication. We'll review the full cost of your specific protocol before you commit. We do not bill insurance directly, but we provide itemized superbills that many Eastside patients submit to plans like Premera Blue Cross, Regence BlueShield, UnitedHealthcare, and Aetna for partial reimbursement.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on tissue. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does peptide therapy fit a tech work schedule?",
      answer:
        "That's exactly why our Bellevue program is telehealth-first. Physician visits happen by video and fit between meetings, lab draws are quick stops at a local Eastside draw site you choose, and compounded medication ships to your door. Follow-ups — dose adjustments, lab reviews, renewals — are handled by video too, with Saturday morning slots available when the workweek is fully booked.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start peptide therapy entirely by telehealth in Bellevue?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Bellevue patients start with a telehealth evaluation by a Strong Health physician licensed in Washington, including a full medical history and a detailed discussion of goals. Baseline labs are ordered to a local lab draw site near you before any peptide is prescribed, and follow-ups — dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — are conducted via telehealth with repeat labs at the same draw site.",

Whether you're rehabbing a knee from a Cottonwoods ski season, nursing a climbing or trail-running tendon back to health, dropping the visceral belly fat a Silicon Slopes desk job put on, sleeping through the night again, or maintaining the body composition you work hard for, we use specific peptides for specific clinical reasons — and we monitor the relevant labs throughout the protocol.",

Peptide therapy done right is physician-led care that starts with bloodwork, not a sales script.",
    "Strong Health designs peptide protocols for Kansas City patients around individual labs and goals. Whether you're a trades or warehouse worker whose shoulders and knees have taken twenty years of abuse, a runner rehabbing a tendon after Hospital Hill, a shift worker trying to sleep like a human again, or someone finally tackling the visceral belly fat that won't budge, we use specific peptides for specific clinical reasons — and we monitor the relevant labs throughout the protocol.",
    "Strong Health is a real medical practice with board-certified physicians and pharmacy-compounded medications dispensed under physician orders. KC metro patients are served via telehealth by physicians licensed in their state, with baseline and monitoring labs drawn at local lab draw sites on both sides of the state line. We don't sell supplement subscriptions. We don't push gray-market compounds. Every protocol is reviewed at scheduled intervals and adjusted based on how your body actually responds.",

    "From Plaza med spas to Westport recovery lounges, the KC metro has a growing number of places offering peptides — but very few that combine board-certified physician oversight with real lab monitoring and pharmacy-grade compounds from licensed compounders. Most Kansas City patients we see have already tried at least one place that handed them a vial after a 10-minute video call.",
    "We built Strong Health's Kansas City telehealth program around the principle that peptide therapy is real medicine: contraindications need to be screened, doses need to be titrated, and labs need to be monitored — whether you're in Brookside, out in Lee's Summit or Liberty, or across the line in Overland Park. That's the standard.",

      question: "Where can I get peptide therapy in Kansas City?",
      answer:
        "Strong Health serves Kansas City peptide-therapy patients by appointment via telehealth. Physician consultations happen by video with doctors licensed in your state, and baseline and monitoring labs are drawn at local lab draw sites across the metro — from Downtown and Brookside to the Northland, Lee's Summit, Independence, and Johnson County. Call (754) 263-6026 to book a free assessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What peptides does Strong Health prescribe for Kansas City patients?",
      answer:
        "Our physicians prescribe pharmacy-grade peptides selected for the patient's specific goals and labs. The most commonly used protocols include BPC-157 and TB-500 for tendon, joint, and soft-tissue healing; CJC-1295 with Ipamorelin for body composition, sleep, and recovery; Tesamorelin for visceral (belly) fat reduction; PT-141 for sexual desire and arousal; DSIP for deep-sleep architecture; and clinical-grade collagen peptides for connective tissue and skin support. Every protocol is individualized — we don't use one-size-fits-all stacks.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are peptides legal in Missouri?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when prescribed by a physician licensed in Missouri and dispensed through a licensed compounding pharmacy. Strong Health works only with 503A and 503B pharmacies under physician orders. We do not work with research-only or gray-market peptides. Every protocol uses pharmacy-grade product with full physician oversight, ongoing monitoring, and standard medical-record documentation.",
    },
    {
      question: "I live on the Kansas side of the metro — can I still use Strong Health?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Telehealth care is matched to where you live: Missouri-side patients see physicians licensed in Missouri, and patients in Overland Park, Leawood, Olathe, Shawnee, and the rest of Johnson and Wyandotte counties are seen by physicians licensed in Kansas. Lab draw sites are available on both sides of the state line, so the experience is the same wherever in the metro you are.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does peptide therapy cost for Kansas City patients?",
      answer:
        "Your initial telehealth consult is free. Peptide protocols are month-to-month with transparent pricing — costs vary by peptide, dose, and duration. Most protocols include physician visits, monitoring labs, and pharmacy-compounded medication. We'll review the full cost of your specific protocol before you commit. We do not bill insurance directly, but we provide itemized superbills that many KC patients submit to plans like Blue KC, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Cigna for partial reimbursement.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is peptide therapy different from TRT or GLP-1 weight loss medications?",
      answer:
        "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as targeted signaling molecules — they're distinct from steroid hormones like testosterone and from GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Healing peptides (BPC-157, TB-500) work on tissue repair pathways with no androgenic effect. GH-secretagogue peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin) prompt your pituitary to release more of your own growth hormone in its natural pulsatile pattern. Peptide therapy can be combined with TRT or GLP-1 weight-loss programs, and many Strong Health patients run integrated protocols designed and monitored by the same physician.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from peptide therapy?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the peptide and the goal. Sleep and recovery improvements (DSIP, Ipamorelin) are often noticeable within 2–4 weeks. Body-composition changes from CJC-1295/Ipamorelin or Tesamorelin typically appear at 8–12 weeks with more visible lean mass and fat-distribution shifts at 3–6 months. Tendon and joint healing protocols using BPC-157 or TB-500 generally run 4–12 weeks depending on tissue. PT-141 for sexual health works on demand, typically within 30–90 minutes of dosing. Every Strong Health protocol includes scheduled lab reassessments to confirm progress and adjust doses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start peptide therapy entirely by telehealth in Kansas City?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Kansas City patients start with a telehealth evaluation by a Strong Health physician licensed in their state, including a full medical history and a detailed discussion of goals. Baseline labs are ordered to a local lab draw site near you before any peptide is prescribed, and follow-ups — dose adjustments, lab reviews, and renewal authorizations — are conducted via telehealth with repeat labs at the same draw site.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which KC metro cities and neighborhoods do you serve?",
      answer:
        "The whole metro, both sides of the state line — Downtown and Power & Light, River Market, the Crossroads, Westport, the Plaza, Brookside, Waldo, and Midtown, plus North Kansas City, Gladstone, Liberty, and Parkville in the Northland, Lee's Summit, Independence, Blue Springs, and Raytown to the east, and Overland Park, Leawood, Olathe, and Shawnee in Johnson County. Because care is delivered via telehealth with labs at local lab draw sites, you can start and stay on a protocol wherever in the metro you live.",
