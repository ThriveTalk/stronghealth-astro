        "PRP stands for platelet-rich plasma. We draw a small amount of your own blood and spin it in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets, which carry growth factors that signal your body to repair tissue. That concentrate is then injected into (or microneedled over) the treatment area: the scalp for hair, the face for skin quality, the under-eye area for hollowing and crepey skin, or a joint or tendon for orthopedic recovery.

A physician confirms PRP is appropriate for your specific goal before treating.",

    {
      question: "How much does PRP cost in Miami?",
      answer:
        "At Strong Health Miami, PRP hair restoration typically runs $600–$900 per session, PRP facials with microneedling $650–$950, PRP under-eye treatment $600–$850, and PRP joint or tendon injections $700–$1,200 per site. Most cosmetic PRP goals need a series of about 3 sessions spaced 4–6 weeks apart, with maintenance afterward, and package pricing is available. PRP is elective and rarely covered by insurance. We confirm your full price up front, and there are no memberships or subscriptions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does PRP really work for hair loss?",
      answer:
        "For androgenetic alopecia (male- and female-pattern thinning), published systematic reviews and meta-analyses report that PRP scalp injections can increase hair density and thickness, especially in earlier-stage thinning where the follicles are miniaturized but not gone. It works best as part of a series with maintenance, and often alongside proven therapies like minoxidil or finasteride. PRP will not regrow hair on a scalp that is completely bald in an area, and results vary between patients, which is why we start with a physician assessment rather than selling a package sight unseen.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many PRP sessions will I need and when will I see results?",
      answer:
        "Most cosmetic PRP protocols (hair, facial, and under-eye) start with a series of about 3 sessions spaced 4–6 weeks apart, followed by maintenance every 4–6 months. Hair results are gradual: reduced shedding first, then visible density changes over 3–6 months. Skin and under-eye improvements in texture and brightness typically show over 4–12 weeks. Joint and tendon injections are often 1–3 sessions, with recovery measured over weeks to a few months. We track your progress with standardized photos at each visit.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is PRP painful, and is there downtime?",
      answer:
        "PRP uses fine needles, and we apply topical numbing before scalp, facial, and under-eye treatments to keep it comfortable. Most patients describe it as very tolerable. Downtime is minimal: expect some redness, mild swelling, or pinpoint tenderness for 1–3 days, and for under-eye and facial work occasionally light bruising. Most Miami patients return to normal activity the same day and to the gym within 24–48 hours. Joint injections may ask for a short period of relative rest, which the physician will review with you.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is PRP safe?",
      answer:
        "Because PRP is made from your own blood, the safety profile is favorable: there's no risk of allergic reaction or rejection to a foreign substance. The most common effects are temporary: injection-site soreness, redness, swelling, or minor bruising. As with any injection, there is a small risk of infection or bruising, which is minimized by drawing and processing blood under proper medical conditions and having a physician perform the treatment. We screen for contraindications (certain blood disorders, active infection, some medications) during your consultation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can PRP be combined with microneedling or other treatments?",
      answer:
        "Yes. PRP with medical microneedling is one of our most popular Miami facial protocols; the microneedling creates controlled micro-channels that let the platelet growth factors reach deeper into the skin. For hair, PRP is often combined with topical or oral therapies. And for men dealing with hair thinning alongside low energy or libido, PRP hair restoration pairs naturally with a hormone (TRT) or peptide workup, all available at the same Brickell clinic and coordinated by the same physicians.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is PRP different from fillers or a hair transplant?",
      answer:
        "Dermal fillers add synthetic volume (usually hyaluronic acid) instantly; PRP instead stimulates your own tissue to improve quality and thickness gradually, with no foreign material. For hair, a transplant surgically relocates follicles and is a one-time procedure for advanced loss, whereas PRP is a non-surgical, injection-based treatment best suited to earlier thinning or to support a transplant's results. The two approaches complement each other, and during your consultation a physician will tell you honestly which one fits your situation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer Spanish-speaking PRP consultations in Miami?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Our Brickell clinic offers care in English and Spanish. Dr. Rivera and several team members are fluent in Spanish, and consultations, treatments, and follow-ups can all be conducted in Spanish if you prefer.",
